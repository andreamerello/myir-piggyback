Piggyback board for Z-Turn Myir
===============================

In this repo you can find the (simple) schematic, the PCB design, and gerber files, for a breakout board for the Z-Turn Myir board.

The board simply routes all the signals from Z-Turn expansion connector to two regular 2.54 (like RPi/Arduino) pinstrips.

The design is made with KiCad.

*WARNING*: I've not build it yet. Not tested...
